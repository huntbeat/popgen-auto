- Currently working on generating input for discrimative model, as a combination of sequential and summary statistics. We can try to just use the entire sequence, and we can still think about how to add perimeter control on the GAN.

With the architecture and data ready, need to think about how to make everything come together. Of biggest importance is how to verify whether a simulated sequence is good enough to match a region of interest. Maybe come up with a metric that uses summary statistics, or use the discriminator model to compare msprime data from gan data. Not sure...

Sub-population to reduce variation
But we expect variability
