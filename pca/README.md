- Began work on PCA. At least with current settings, PCA does not seem too effective for figuring out the dimensions for natural selection. Could try more individuals, changing fixation settings, adding a few more axes, etc.

- If PCA is not good enough, it does mean that summary statistics is not good enough to check whether a simulation is good enough to match a real sequence (actually not sure...)
